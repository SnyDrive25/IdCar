We made 3 spaces for every stakeholder so that it is usable by the dealership, the car owner or the mechanics in the same website.

Steps of a car life :
- The dealer creates the client's wallet
- The dealer transfers the car ownership to the client with a car ERC-721 token
- The client can check his car's information that is stored
- Another client can check if the car is really owned by a specific person.
- The client can send his car in reparation or maintenance to a mechanic who will store new ERC-721 tokens that represent the pieces that were changed.
- The mechanics can relate about the car mileage when he gets the car at the garage and he can store a new token with the mileage value.
- The client can sell his car to another person by himself while entering the future owner's public address.
